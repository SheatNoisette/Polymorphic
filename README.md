# Polymorphic/Metamorphic experiments
Some short experiments about polymophic/metamorphic code.

`Simple` contains a basic program what cypher his own payload using XOR Ecryption.
When ran, it will try to copy his own content to another file which the payload 
was again cyphered using another random key. It's a proof of concept of a polymorphic
code. The encryption and self - copy functions are not encrypted nor rewritten.
